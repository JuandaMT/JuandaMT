# Hey, I'm Juanda 🤓

Full-stack developer specialized in turning ideas into real projects. I specialize in the **MERN/MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Angular, Node.js) and I'm obsessed with clean code, performance, and solving problems.

## What I do

I build **scalable web applications** from zero to production. Over the last two years, I've been learning by iterating and improving a little bit every day, and I love it.

**Frontend focus:**
- React, TypeScript, and modern development practices
- Style guides, design systems, and component architecture
- Git & GitHub workflows, CI/CD pipelines
- Clean code principles and agile methodologies
- Strong communicator. I believe great code means nothing without good communication

**Backend focus:**
- Node.js & Express with clean, scalable architecture
- Building secure systems that actually stand the test of time
- REST APIs, authentication flows, payment gateways
- MongoDB, Firebase Firestore
- Process automation and system optimization

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**
- Docker containerization, Google Cloud Run deployments
- CI/CD pipeline setup and optimization

I'm proactive about learning. Every day I look for ways to write better code, improve our processes, and solve problems more elegantly.

## What drives me

I'm obsessed with continuous improvement. I think about architecture, scalability, security, and how teams can work better together. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and apply it the next day.

I had the pleasure of mentoring junior developers. I genuinely think teaching reinforces my own knowledge and I love seeing others grow. I do enjoy complex problems and the collaborative process of solving them.

## Some things I've built

- **E-commerce automation systems** with modular architecture and state management using Zustand
- **Multi-provider authentication flows** (Google, Microsoft, email/password) with Firebase
- **Email notification systems** with dynamic templates and proper email infrastructure (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- **Performance analysis tools** and optimization strategies for web applications
- **Learning management systems** with complex data transformations and progress tracking
