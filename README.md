# Hey, I'm Juanda 👋

Full-stack developer based in Spain with a passion for building web applications that actually work. I specialize in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and I'm obsessed with clean code, performance, and solving real problems.

## What I do

I build **scalable web applications** from zero to production. My experience includes:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, modern UI/UX with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, authentication systems
- **Database**: MongoDB, Firebase Firestore
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Docker, Google Cloud Run, deployment pipelines
- **Additional skills**: PHP, Angular, Firebase authentication, payment integrations, process automation

I've spent over two years at a startup handling everything from API integrations to payment gateways, authentication flows, and security implementations. I love automating processes and making things more efficient.

## What drives me

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies. Currently diving deeper into **TypeScript**, **Docker**, and modern development patterns. I also mentor junior developers and enjoy collaborating on projects that push me out of my comfort zone.

## Some things I've built

- **E-commerce automation systems** with modular architecture and state management using Zustand
- **Multi-provider authentication flows** (Google, Microsoft, email/password) with Firebase
- **Email notification systems** with dynamic templates and proper email infrastructure (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- **Performance analysis tools** and optimization strategies for web applications
- **Learning management systems** with complex data transformations and progress tracking
